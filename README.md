# Windows-95-Product-Key-Generator
A phyton code to generate a product key for Windows 95.

The phyton  code can be found at "Generator.py" file. 

Paste the code into your phyton editor. (Works on Phyton 3 only) 

If the generator doesn't work for you, you'll need to deal with it, but you can contact me on what's wrong with it. (While contacting me, please, be as specific as possible and write what version or OEM of Windows 95 you are using.)
